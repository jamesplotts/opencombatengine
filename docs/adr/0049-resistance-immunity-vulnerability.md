# ADR 0049: Resistance, Immunity, and Vulnerability Features

## Status
Accepted

## Context
Creatures need to support Resistances, Immunities, and Vulnerabilities, and these traits need to be parsed from feature descriptions (e.g., "Resistance to Fire").

## Decision
We updated `ICombatStats` to support dynamic addition/removal of Immunities and Vulnerabilities (Resistances were already supported).
We implemented `DamageAffinityFeature` to handle these traits.
We updated `FeatureFactory` to parse strings like "Resistance to [Type]", "Immunity to [Type]", and "Vulnerability to [Type]".

## Consequences
- `ICombatStats` interface has changed (breaking change for custom implementations).
- `StandardCombatStats` now fully supports all three damage affinity types.
- Feature parsing now handles damage affinities automatically.
